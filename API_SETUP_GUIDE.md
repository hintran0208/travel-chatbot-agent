After registering for all services, update your `.env` file with the credentials:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration (already configured)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-IXzuMh_OeMdLACbNjuIj6g
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aiportalapi.stu-platform.live/jpe
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=GPT-4o-mini

# RapidAPI Key (for hotel search via Booking.com API)
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here

# ExchangeRate-API (for currency conversion with VND support)
EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY=your_exchangerate_api_key_here

# Amadeus API (for flight search)
AMADEUS_API_KEY=your_amadeus_api_key_here
AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_amadeus_api_secret_here

# OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here

# Foursquare API (for local activities)
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=your_foursquare_api_key_here
```

### 2. Test the APIs
Once all credentials are added, start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will automatically:
- Use real APIs when credentials are available
- Fall back to mock data if any API fails or credentials are missing
- Display helpful error messages in the console for debugging

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Rate Limits**: All APIs have rate limits. The application includes error handling to gracefully fall back to mock data if limits are exceeded.

2. **API Keys Security**: Never commit your actual API keys to version control. Keep them in your `.env` file only.

3. **Testing**: Start with one API at a time to ensure each integration works correctly.

4. **Monitoring**: Keep track of your API usage through each provider's dashboard to avoid exceeding free tier limits.

5. **Fallback System**: The application is designed to work even if some APIs are unavailable - it will use mock data as a fallback.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If an API isn't working**:
1. Check that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
2. Verify your account is active and verified
3. Check the console output for specific error messages
4. Ensure you haven't exceeded your API limits
5. Try testing the API directly in the provider's documentation

**Common Issues**:
- **Amadeus**: Make sure to use the test environment URLs initially
- **RapidAPI**: Ensure you've subscribed to the Booking.com API specifically
- **OpenWeatherMap**: API keys may take up to 10 minutes to activate
- **Foursquare**: Make sure to use the v3 API endpoints
